Image Archiver made in discord.py

Made by alf#9999 (https://alf.wtf/)

Do $archive [channel id] and it'll download all the images/gifs from that channel.
                                 or
$transfer [channel id to take the files from] [channel id to send them to] and it'll get all the urls of the images in channel 1 and send them to channel 2 (Bot must be in both servers)
